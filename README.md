# cookiekiller
Kill that annoying cookie alert. Either you know what it is for or not, it's just useless. Let cookiekiller shut it off for you.
To install, follow this: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

This is a really alpha version. Just a couple of cookie bar are removed (like this one http://www.primebox.co.uk/examples/cookiebar/1/). 
Looking for contributors!
